# Module Project: Component Side Effects- NASA APOD

This will be a two-module project. In it you will consume the NASA API to fetch the "Astronomy Photo Of The Day" or APOD. Once you fetch the data, you will build a few components that will render different pieces of data in your interface.

## Features

- Includes custom carousel code
- Includes toolbar at the bottom of the page with controls and more information about each image, toolbar hides automatically when not hovered
- Keyboard shortcuts "left" and "right" allow users to look at the images fullscreen without obscuring them with the toolbar controls
- Images are implemented as background-images of a purely display styled component and passed in through props
